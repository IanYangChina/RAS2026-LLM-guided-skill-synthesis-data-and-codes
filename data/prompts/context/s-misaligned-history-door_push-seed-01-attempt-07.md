**Proposal policy**: task_score is near-perfect (1.00). Preserve useful working parts and make only evidence-backed refinements. A HOLD is acceptable if you genuinely cannot find a better structure.

## Optimisation Objective

Your goal is to **maximise task_score first, then composite score Q**:

> **Primary objective: task_score** — the fraction of episodes where the robot successfully completes the task. This is the most important metric. **Never propose a simpler or shorter skill if it reduces task_score.**

> **Q = fitness_score + termination_fidelity − complexity_penalty**

- `fitness_score`: shaped task reward (includes phase progress for contact-rich tasks)
- `termination_fidelity`: fraction of phases that terminated by designed condition (not timeout)
- `complexity_penalty`: cost for over-parameterised or over-phased designs

**Warning**: Do not reduce phases or parameters to lower complexity if doing so reduces task_score. Structure complexity is only penalised when it adds no performance gain.

> ⚠️ **SUBTASK STRUCTURE CAUTION**: The current best task_score is 1.000, which indicates the subtask decomposition is already effective.
> Preserve the current subtask decomposition unless the evidence shows a subtask change is necessary. Prefer refining phases, parameters, control modes, or termination conditions first.
> Unnecessary subtask redesign when performance is already high often causes regression.

## Subtask Layer

**Mode**: free (you define subtask targets; use `subtasks:` block in your YAML)

Define subtasks in a `subtasks:` block **before** `phases:`. Each subtask specifies an intermediate optimisation target.

**Required fields** — always include both, never omit:
- `anchor` (**required**): fixture | goal | object | world
- `target_entity` (**required**): hinge | object | tcp

Subtask anchors are separate from phase `target.anchor` vocabulary: subtasks use `world | object | goal | fixture`, while phase targets use `world | task_goal | task_object | fixture | body | site | current_tcp`.

Optional fields:
- `metric`: contact | distance | goal_progress | hinge_angle (default: distance)
- `offset`: [x, y, z] in metres relative to anchor (default: [0, 0, 0])
- `param_offset_key`: CMA-ES parameter added to offset at runtime (optional)
- `weight`: scoring weight [0.1, 1.0] (default: 1.0)

**Anchor resolution for this task** — choose anchor so the resolved position is meaningful:
| Anchor | Resolves to | Best used for |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `world` | absolute world-frame coordinate | fixed reference points not tied to objects |
| `object` | offset from object initial position | approach/contact targets near object |
| `goal` | offset from task goal position | final destination targets |
| `fixture` | offset from fixture pose (0.5, 0.2, 0.0) | approach/contact targets near fixture |

Annotate each phase with `subtask_id: <id>` to bind it to a subtask.
Only the **last phase** bound to a given subtask contributes to subtask scoring.

Example (two subtasks — one near object start, one at goal):
```yaml
subtasks:
  - id: reach_pre_contact
    anchor: object         # resolved to object initial position (see table above)
    target_entity: tcp     # score TCP distance to this target
    metric: distance
    offset: [0.0, 0.0, 0.10]  # 10 cm above object start position
    weight: 0.3
  - id: reach_goal
    anchor: goal           # resolved to task goal position (see table above)
    target_entity: tcp
    metric: distance
    offset: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    weight: 0.7
phases:
  - id: approach_1
    type: approach
    subtask_id: reach_pre_contact
    ...
  - id: push_1
    type: push
    subtask_id: reach_goal
    ...
```

- **fitness_score**: 1.000  *(CMA-ES inner optimisation target; = task_score for most tasks; includes phase progress bonus for contact-rich tasks)*
- **Termination Fidelity** (C): 0.000
  → phases frequently time out instead of reaching designed conditions
- **Force Compliance**: 0.000
- **Complexity Penalty**: 0.200

## Per-Phase Performance

| Phase | Normal Term. Rate | Contact Rate | Mean Displacement (m) |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| approach_1 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.1696 |
| push_1 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.1617 |

## Last Optimised Execution State

Mean phase-boundary state across the latest CMA-ES optimised traces (up to 8 phases; values rounded to 3 decimals).

| Phase | Type | Normal / reason | TCP start→end | Object start→end | Obj→goal start→end | Contact rate / events | Peak force | Raw peak force |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| approach_1 | approach | 1.00 / step_budget | (0.100, 0.399, 0.350)→(0.100, 0.230, 0.348) | (0.000, 0.000, 0.000)→(0.000, 0.000, 0.000) | 0.406→0.406 | 1.00 / 1.000 | 9.307 | 45.954 |

## Task Sub-Scores

These are diagnostics / optimiser fitness-shaping signals, not a guaranteed decomposition of canonical task_score.

- hinge_angle_ratio: 1.000
- arc_quality: 1.000

## CMA-ES Diagnostics

- **Best shaped reward** (fitness_score): 1.000
  *(shaped task+phase signal; this is the CMA-ES objective)*
- **Best task_score**: 1.000
- **Median Q (composite search score)**: 0.800
- **K-run variance**: 0.0000
- **Stagnated**: yes
  → Parameter optimiser converged to local optimum; structural change likely needed
- **Stop reason**: tolfun
- **Mean generations**: 5.7
- **Final σ (mean)**: 0.270
