**Proposal policy**: task_score is 0.00 — NOT near-perfect (target ≥ 0.9). Do NOT hold or make cosmetic tweaks. Make any coherent updates needed to address the diagnosed failure while preserving useful working structure. Use the Mutation History above to avoid repeating failed edits. - task_score ≈ 0: add or repair missing prerequisites, targets, guard/retry logic, generator/control choices, subtasks, or phase-ordering errors that block task progress.
- task_score stagnant: change coupled targets, parameters, terminations, phase types, controls, subtasks, or ordering when evidence shows they need to change together.
A HOLD wastes an iteration when task_score is below 0.9.

## Optimisation Objective

Your goal is to **maximise task_score first, then composite score Q**:

> **Primary objective: task_score** — the fraction of episodes where the robot successfully completes the task. This is the most important metric. **Never propose a simpler or shorter skill if it reduces task_score.**

> **Q = fitness_score + termination_fidelity − complexity_penalty**

- `fitness_score`: shaped task reward (includes phase progress for contact-rich tasks)
- `termination_fidelity`: fraction of phases that terminated by designed condition (not timeout)
- `complexity_penalty`: cost for over-parameterised or over-phased designs

**Warning**: Do not reduce phases or parameters to lower complexity if doing so reduces task_score. Structure complexity is only penalised when it adds no performance gain.

## Executable Phase Semantics

Visible executable target/binding metadata from the compiled controller:
- **approach_over_obstacle** (`approach`)
  - target: source=yaml, anchor=task_goal, offset=[0.0, 0.0, 0.25], tolerance=0.005
  - parameter_bindings:
    - approach_speed: status=consumed; consumers=generator.speed (replace)
    - z_clearance: status=consumed; consumers=target.offset.z (replace)
- **descend_to_goal** (`descend`)
  - target: source=yaml, anchor=task_goal, offset=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], tolerance=0.01
  - parameter_bindings:
    - descend_speed: status=consumed; consumers=generator.speed (replace)
  - guards:
    - id=force_limit, when=during_phase, predicate=force_below, on_failure=abort, threshold=5.0

## Design Metrics

- **Composite score**: -0.200
- **task_score** (E): 0.000
- **fitness_score**: 0.000  *(CMA-ES inner optimisation target; = task_score for most tasks; includes phase progress bonus for contact-rich tasks)*
  → CMA-ES cannot optimise this structure (shaped reward also near zero)
- **Termination Fidelity** (C): 0.000
  → phases frequently time out instead of reaching designed conditions
- **Force Compliance**: 0.000
- **Complexity Penalty**: 0.200

**⚠ Warning**: CMA-ES stagnated + low fitness_score → structure may be fundamentally incompatible with task

- obstacle_clearance: 0.748
- path_efficiency: 0.459
- arc_smoothness: 0.997
- collision_factor: 0.000  (exp(−peak_force / force_scale))
- peak_obstacle_force: 175.043 N
- collision_location: obstacle_block  (or None if no contact)
- final_tcp_distance: 0.010
- min_tcp_distance: 0.010
- tcp_proximity_score: 0.936
- goal_reached_rate: 1.000

  *(shaped task+phase signal; this is the CMA-ES objective)*
- **Best task_score**: 0.000
- **Median Q (composite search score)**: -0.200
- **K-run variance**: 0.0000
- **Stagnated**: yes
  → Parameter optimiser converged to local optimum; structural change likely needed
- **Stop reason**: tolfun
- **Mean generations**: 2.0
- **Final σ (mean)**: 0.326
