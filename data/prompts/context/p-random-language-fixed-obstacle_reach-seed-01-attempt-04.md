**Proposal policy**: task_score is near-perfect (0.94). Preserve useful working parts and make only evidence-backed refinements. A HOLD is acceptable if you genuinely cannot find a better structure.

## Optimisation Objective

Your goal is to **maximise task_score first, then composite score Q**:

> **Primary objective: task_score** — the fraction of episodes where the robot successfully completes the task. This is the most important metric. **Never propose a simpler or shorter skill if it reduces task_score.**

> **Q = fitness_score + termination_fidelity − complexity_penalty**

- `fitness_score`: shaped task reward (includes phase progress for contact-rich tasks)
- `termination_fidelity`: fraction of phases that terminated by designed condition (not timeout)
- `complexity_penalty`: cost for over-parameterised or over-phased designs

**Warning**: Do not reduce phases or parameters to lower complexity if doing so reduces task_score. Structure complexity is only penalised when it adds no performance gain.
