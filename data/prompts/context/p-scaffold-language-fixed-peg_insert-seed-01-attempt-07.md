**Proposal policy**: task_score is near-perfect (0.94). Preserve useful working parts and make only evidence-backed refinements. A HOLD is acceptable if you genuinely cannot find a better structure.

## Optimisation Objective

Your goal is to **maximise task_score first, then composite score Q**:

> **Primary objective: task_score** — the fraction of episodes where the robot successfully completes the task. This is the most important metric. **Never propose a simpler or shorter skill if it reduces task_score.**

> **Q = fitness_score + termination_fidelity − complexity_penalty**

- `fitness_score`: shaped task reward (includes phase progress for contact-rich tasks)
- `termination_fidelity`: fraction of phases that terminated by designed condition (not timeout)
- `complexity_penalty`: cost for over-parameterised or over-phased designs

**Warning**: Do not reduce phases or parameters to lower complexity if doing so reduces task_score. Structure complexity is only penalised when it adds no performance gain.

# Proposal Context

## Task Specification

- Task name: peg_insert
- Frozen realised-scene SHA-256: `8f814a9d9dd9825bee110b06b2d985dbb0aa82505ba300f6022b2e21e7c15f67`
- Frozen object start: [0.5039660180420721, -2.3990369582946034e-19, 0.34030658323767055]
- Frozen task target: [0.5009457299760205, 0.03603709570607482, 0.08]
- Frozen socket pose: [0.5009457299760205, 0.03603709570607482, 0.025] (static fixture for this episode)
- Goal object position: (0.5009457299760205, 0.03603709570607482, 0.025)
- Object initial pose: (0.5039660180420721, -2.3990369582946034e-19, 0.34030658323767055)
- Goal tolerance: 0.02 m
- Expressivity sigma: 0.15 m
- Expressivity threshold: 0.3
- Force limit: 40.0 N
- Channel axis: `(0.0, 0.0, -1.0)` — use `impedance_control` to absorb lateral wall forces
- Robot initial TCP position: (0.5, 0.0, 0.3)
- Phase navigation guidance: the task `phase_target_map` may provide internal predefined TCP waypoint aliases / semantic phase ids. These names are not DSL phase types and are intentionally not enumerated here to avoid confusing ids with types. Phase `id` may be semantic, but phase `type` must be exactly one of the DSL enum values listed in the prompt.
- Primary evaluation target: **insertion depth ratio (axial progress into hole)**

## Subtask Layer

**Mode**: fixed (subtask targets are defined by the task configuration)

Available subtask IDs for phase binding:
| Subtask ID | Anchor | Target offset (m) | Metric | CMA-ES offset param |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| align | object | (0.00, 0.00, 0.12) | distance | — |
| approach | object | (0.00, 0.00, 0.09) | distance | — |
| contact | object | (0.00, 0.00, 0.07) | distance | — |
| insert | object | (0.00, 0.00, 0.06) | distance | — |

Annotate phases with `subtask_id: <id>` to bind them to a subtask target.
- A phase bound to a subtask receives a navigation waypoint computed from that subtask's anchor and offset.
- Only the **last phase** bound to a given subtask is used for subtask scoring.
- Phases without `subtask_id` are not scored against subtasks but still execute normally.
