**Proposal policy**: task_score is 0.79 — NOT near-perfect (target ≥ 0.9). Do NOT hold or make cosmetic tweaks. Make any coherent updates needed to address the diagnosed failure while preserving useful working structure. Use the Mutation History above to avoid repeating failed edits. - task_score ≈ 0: add or repair missing prerequisites, targets, guard/retry logic, generator/control choices, subtasks, or phase-ordering errors that block task progress.
- task_score stagnant: change coupled targets, parameters, terminations, phase types, controls, subtasks, or ordering when evidence shows they need to change together.
A HOLD wastes an iteration when task_score is below 0.9.

## Optimisation Objective

Your goal is to **maximise task_score first, then composite score Q**:

> **Primary objective: task_score** — the fraction of episodes where the robot successfully completes the task. This is the most important metric. **Never propose a simpler or shorter skill if it reduces task_score.**

> **Q = fitness_score + termination_fidelity − complexity_penalty**

- `fitness_score`: shaped task reward (includes phase progress for contact-rich tasks)
- `termination_fidelity`: fraction of phases that terminated by designed condition (not timeout)
- `complexity_penalty`: cost for over-parameterised or over-phased designs

**Warning**: Do not reduce phases or parameters to lower complexity if doing so reduces task_score. Structure complexity is only penalised when it adds no performance gain.

# Proposal Context

## Task Specification

- Task name: grasp_place
- Frozen realised-scene SHA-256: `0143f6b0f71a2b9dc1b332d50c0ca91b210f169a33e3f94f972cb0659a69dba8`
- Frozen object start: [0.5370249203970084, -0.021318279091244466, 0.03]
- Frozen task target: [0.6103148150051562, 0.2277534082920179, 0.2074111944405348]
- Goal object position: (0.6103148150051562, 0.2277534082920179, 0.2074111944405348)
- place_goal_position (task success criterion — final object 3D position must be close to the realised airborne target here): (0.6103148150051562, 0.2277534082920179, 0.2074111944405348)
- Grasp/lift components are optimiser fitness diagnostics only; canonical task_score is final object-to-realised-target proximity.
- Object initial pose: (0.5370249203970084, -0.021318279091244466, 0.03)
- Goal tolerance: 0.02 m
- Expressivity sigma: 0.15 m
- Expressivity threshold: 0.3
- Force limit: 20.0 N
- Robot initial TCP position: (0.5, 0.0, 0.3)
- Robot initial gripper state: **open** (gripper starts fully open; ensure a `grasp`/`force_grasp` phase closes it before lifting)
- Phase navigation guidance: the task `phase_target_map` may provide internal predefined TCP waypoint aliases / semantic phase ids. These names are not DSL phase types and are intentionally not enumerated here to avoid confusing ids with types. Phase `id` may be semantic, but phase `type` must be exactly one of the DSL enum values listed in the prompt.
- Primary evaluation target: **final object-to-realised-airborne-3D-target proximity. Grasp/lift signals are optimiser fitness diagnostics only; they do not gate the canonical task_score.**

## Subtask Layer

**Mode**: fixed (subtask targets are defined by the task configuration)

Available subtask IDs for phase binding:
| Subtask ID | Anchor | Target offset (m) | Metric | CMA-ES offset param |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| approach_1 | object | (0.00, 0.00, 0.00) | distance | approach_height |
| descend_1 | object | (0.00, 0.00, 0.02) | distance | grasp_z_offset |
| grasp_1 | object | (0.00, 0.00, 0.02) | contact | — |
| transport_arc | goal | (0.00, 0.00, 0.00) | distance | — |
| release_1 | goal | (0.00, 0.00, 0.00) | distance | — |

Annotate phases with `subtask_id: <id>` to bind them to a subtask target.
- A phase bound to a subtask receives a navigation waypoint computed from that subtask's anchor and offset.
- Only the **last phase** bound to a given subtask is used for subtask scoring.
- Phases without `subtask_id` are not scored against subtasks but still execute normally.
